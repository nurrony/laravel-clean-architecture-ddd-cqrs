# Laravel Clean Architecture, DDD & CQRS Project

This Laravel project applies the principles of Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable web application. It is designed for developers who aim to build complex systems with a clear separation of concerns and a strong alignment between the business domain and technology.
